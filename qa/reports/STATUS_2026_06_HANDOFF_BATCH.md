# STATUS — 2026-06 Handoff Batch (Regression Net Rebuild, Handoff 5)

**Branch:** `duwaragie-round2-fixes` · **LAST_GREEN:** `55e93fb` (2026-05-21, last `qa/reports/` update) · **Window:** 48 unique commits on dev∪main since LAST_GREEN.

**Scope (Path A, confirmed 2026-06-04):** H5 covers the IN-BRANCH window — H1–H4 baseline + W1–W10 (Duwaragie's 05-22 threshold/verification/med-hold batch + Lakshitha's Reading-model). **Deferred to Handoff 6** (on dev/main but NOT in this branch — can't test code not in the tree): X1 COORDINATOR role + invite/activation + migration, X2 privacy-trust/consent, X3 magic-link fix, X4 low-literacy icons, X5 admin sidebar/chart, X6 demo video, X7 styling sweeps.

**Attribution note:** No Niva/Nivakaran commits in the window (confirmed by author+email enumeration + content grep + merge-commit inspection). Cluster 8 / Gap5 / B1-B5 landed **pre-LAST_GREEN (2026-05-20 < 05-21)** — already in the green baseline, not the catch-up window.

| E — CI audit | e2e.yml **already memory-compliant** (Playwright on PR→dev/main; `CI:true` reporter marker; `npm run build`+compiled start; `migrate deploy`+`generate`; `build:shared` first). No repair. **Finding surfaced:** backend unit gate (`llm-tests.yml`) doesn't trigger on PR→dev (only push:phase/* + PR:main); adding `dev` would also pull in costly LLM-judge jobs — surfaced for decision. | — (no repair) |

## Wave G — notification-tab investigation (G.1 / G.2 / G.3) — HELD before patch

**Corrected scope (Duwaragie 2026-06-04):** the mirror is on the **escalation T+0 dispatch** path, not the alert-fire path. Dispatch TO PROVIDERS stays; dispatch TO PATIENT on a bell-visible channel must not land in the Notifications tab. Patient still sees the alert in the Alerts tab + dashboard banner.

**G.1 — fire path (confirmed clean):** `persistAlert` writes a DeviationAlert only — no patient Notification. alert-engine `:1076` is a **provider** CAD-ramp notice. So the FIRE path does not mirror.

**G.1 — escalation T+0 path (the real mirror):** `writeNotificationsAndEmit` (escalation.service.ts ~815) fans out one `Notification` row per (recipient × channel) for the step's `channels`. The patient is a **T+0 recipient** for the emergency-class ladders (per the F12 comment + ladder-defs.spec): `BP_LEVEL_2`, `BP_LEVEL_2_SYMPTOM_OVERRIDE`, `TIER_1_ANGIOEDEMA` (and the retired BP_LEVEL_1 patient row). T+0 `channels` include `PUSH`, `EMAIL`, `DASHBOARD`.
- **Line 852 already skips `PATIENT + DASHBOARD`** (F12) → so DASHBOARD is NOT the leak (Duwaragie's proposed G.4 target is already a no-op).
- **`PUSH` and `EMAIL` rows ARE written** for the patient (line 856).
- `getNotifications` (daily_journal.service.ts:591) filters **`channel != 'EMAIL'`** → EMAIL is hidden from the tab (#80), but **`PUSH` is NOT** → **the patient's T+0 PUSH Notification row is what appears in the Notifications tab.** This is the mirror (Aisha 185/125 → BP_LEVEL_2 → patient PUSH row).
- **There is NO real push service** (no web-push/FCM/APNs/PushService in the codebase) — `channel:'PUSH'` is *only* a Notification row that the in-app bell renders. So "PUSH still reaches the patient out-of-app" is not currently true; the PUSH row **is** the in-app tab entry.

**G.3 — prior work:** `de7b543` (F12 — strip fire-path bell mirror), `d9e52dd` (Round 2 Group B — inbox = care-team actions only; −63 alert-engine/−28 escalation), `e6eaa4d` (F16 hold dedupe), `1f7effe` (rule-aware bucket), H3 `#80` (EMAIL-channel tab/bell filter). Frontend `/notifications` = two-top-tab split (Alerts | Notifications). **F12/#80 covered fire-path + DASHBOARD + EMAIL, but not the patient T+0 PUSH row.**

**G.2 — AlertTier × T+0 patient dispatch matrix (corrected):**
| AlertTier | Sample rule | Patient a T+0 recipient? | Channels patient gets | Patient PUSH row in Notifications tab today? | What we want |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TIER_1_ANGIOEDEMA | RULE_ACE_ANGIOEDEMA | **Yes** (ANGIOEDEMA_PATIENT_T0) | PUSH (+EMAIL) | **YES — mirror** | Alerts tab only |
| BP_LEVEL_2 | RULE_ABSOLUTE_EMERGENCY | **Yes** | PUSH, EMAIL, DASHBOARD | **YES — mirror** | Alerts tab only |
| BP_LEVEL_2_SYMPTOM_OVERRIDE | RULE_SYMPTOM_OVERRIDE_GENERAL | **Yes** (T+0 and T+2H) | PUSH, EMAIL, DASHBOARD | **YES — mirror** | Alerts tab only |
| TIER_1_CONTRAINDICATION | RULE_PREGNANCY_ACE_ARB | No | — | No | No |
| BP_LEVEL_1_HIGH | RULE_STANDARD_L1_HIGH | No (patient row retired) | — | No | No |
| BP_LEVEL_1_LOW | RULE_STANDARD_L1_LOW | No | — | No | No |
| TIER_3_INFO | RULE_PULSE_PRESSURE_WIDE | No (physician-only) | — | No | No |
| TIER_2_DISCREPANCY | RULE_MEDICATION_MISSED | No | — | No | No |

**G.2 conclusion:** exactly the 3 emergency-class tiers where the patient is a T+0 PUSH recipient mirror into the Notifications tab — matching the "higher-tier mirrors, lower-tier doesn't" observation. The EscalationEvent audit row ("T+0 · Primary + backup + PATIENT · Push+Email+Dashboard") is separate and unaffected by any Notification-row change.

**G.4 decision needed (the implementation surface differs from the original instruction — surfacing, NOT patching):** suppressing only DASHBOARD = no-op (already done). To actually stop the tab mirror, two channel-aware options (both keep the EscalationEvent audit + Alerts tab + provider rows):
- **Option A — query filter (best match to Duwaragie's "mirror #80 / keep PUSH" intent):** extend `getNotifications` + unread-count to also exclude **alert-linked PATIENT PUSH rows** (`alertId != null AND channel = 'PUSH'`). Keeps the row in the DB as the hook for a future real push service; hides it from the in-app tab. Pure read-side, mirrors #80.
- **Option B — suppress the write:** extend line 852 guard to skip `PATIENT + ('DASHBOARD'|'PUSH')`. Drops the row entirely (no loss today since no push service exists). Closer to F12.

Recommend **Option A** (read-side, reversible, preserves the future-push hook, mirrors the #80 pattern Duwaragie cited). **HELD** for Duwaragie to confirm the corrected matrix + pick Option A vs B before G.4/G.5.

## Wave G.4 / G.5 — patch + tests (Option A, read-side filter)

| Item | Code commit | Test | Test commit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G.4 — exclude alert-linked PATIENT PUSH rows from bell list + unread count (read-side; #80 pattern) | `35ade09` | unit (query-construction lock) + unit (email-path-intact) + e2e | `35ade09` / G.5 | ✅ unit / 🟡 e2e (see stack note) |

- **G.4** (`35ade09`): shared `BELL_VISIBLE_NOTIFICATION_FILTER` predicate used by BOTH `getNotifications` + `getNotificationsUnreadCount`. Excludes EMAIL (#80) **and** `{alertId != null AND channel='PUSH'}` (H5 G.4). **Read-side only** — `Notification.create` (escalation.service.ts:856-867) and `emailService.sendEmail` (:892) untouched; no schema migration. System-action PUSH rows (`alertId` null) stay visible.
- **G.5 units** (backend, +4 tests): `daily_journal.service.spec` — getNotifications + unread-count both apply the exclusion predicate (query-construction lock) + scoping note (alertId-null PUSH stays); `escalation.service.spec` — **email-path regression lock**: BP_LEVEL_2 T+0 still WRITES the patient PUSH + EMAIL Notification rows and still calls `emailService.sendEmail` (proves the read filter never suppresses the actual send).
- **G.5 e2e** (`22-notifications-no-alert-mirror.spec.ts`): fires real 185/125 → BP_LEVEL_2, confirms the alert-linked patient PUSH row exists in DB (write intact), asserts the patient notifications API + Notifications tab exclude it while the Alerts tab shows the alert.

### Verification battery (this turn)
- backend `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.build.json` — clean
- backend `jest` — **1290 passed / 62 suites** (was 1278 at H4; +8 W9 + 4 G.5)
- admin `tsc --noEmit` — clean · frontend `tsc --noEmit` — clean

### Playwright run — stack note (surfaced)
The running localhost stack is **mixed across two clones** (confirmed via OS process inspection): frontend `:3000` = `cardioplace-v2` (this branch), **backend `:4000` + admin `:3001` = a separate `_niva_audit` clone**. So the live backend does **not** contain G.4. Smoke run (`--reporter=list`, 11 tests): **10 passed**; the 1 "failure" is the new `22-notifications-no-alert-mirror` spec **correctly detecting the un-patched mirror** on the `_niva_audit` backend (the alert-linked PUSH row was returned) — i.e. the guard works. Not a fix defect (the unit tests prove the predicate). NOT restarted the user's separate-clone backend (cross-tree + unapplied-migration drift vs the shared cloud DB). The e2e goes green once a `cardioplace-v2` backend with G.4 serves `:4000`. Full suite deferred per the "smoke green → full suite" gate (smoke blocked by the cross-clone backend, not by the change).

## Wave C — completed (Category 1 test-debt, authorized 2026-06-04)

| Cluster | Spec(s) | Root cause | Fix | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G.4 — alerts not in bell | `06` 20h.2 + 20h.3 | NOT G.4-mirror (those use seedAlerts→Alerts tab). Stale testIds: `PatientAlertCard` exposes `notification-row-ack-{id}` / `notification-row-detail-{id}`, specs used old `notification-dismiss-button-`/`notification-link-`. | Rename testIds + add defensive "not in Notifications sub-tab" assertion. | `06` commit |
| W10 TZ casing | `06` group-header | Readings restyle made the weekday header UPPERCASE; assertion was case-sensitive. | Case-insensitive weekday compare. | `06` commit |
| H4 wording | `19` A.5 | Manisha Doc 2 superseded the Cluster-7 HCM_LOW "under-perfusion" wording. | Assert the Doc-2 hydration/slow-stand phrase. | `19` commit |
| #91 sessionId | `05a` | #91 made an expired sessionId mint a fresh UUID (never null); spec asserted null. | Assert non-null fresh UUID ≠ expired id. | `05a` commit |

Targeted re-run (`05a` + `06` + `19`): **22 passed, 1 failed** — the 1 is `19 A.7` (below, intentionally not touched).

### NOT fixed — surfaced (NOT Category-1 wording; out of authorized scope)
- **`19` A.7 — HOLD endpoint contract change:** `400 "A hold reason is required to place a medication on hold"`. The verify-medication HOLD endpoint now requires a `reason` (likely W3 med-hold work). Fix = pass a hold reason in the request; it's a contract change, not wording — left for confirmation.
- **`09` (6) + `17` (4) — engine rule-firing BEHAVIOR, not copy:** specs assert co-fire / single-reading outcomes that no longer match (e.g. `17 Q2`: single reading fired `BP_LEVEL_1_HIGH` instead of being HELD; `17 brady`: brady HR rule didn't co-fire; `09 Mike/James/Kate`: symptom-override fired without the expected BP-axis co-fire; `09 Olive`: AGE_65_LOW + loop-diuretic preemption). These assert WHICH RULES fire — editing them blind could mask a regression. Ambiguous root cause (cross-clone `_niva_audit` engine vs real change). **Defer to the Phase-3 clean-stack re-run to disambiguate; do not edit literals.**
- **`05` (2) check-in step-1 testId timeout:** 12s timeout finding the pre-measurement-checklist step; likely W10 CheckIn restructure or flake (passed/failed inconsistently). Not wording. Defer to clean re-run.
